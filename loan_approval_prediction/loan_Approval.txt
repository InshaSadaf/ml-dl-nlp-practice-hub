ðŸ§  **Project Logic Summary: Loan Application Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting loan application approval status using machine learning, leveraging applicant details.

**1. Data Loading & Inspection**
- The dataset, containing 598 entries, is loaded from a CSV file.
- Features include: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and Loan Status.

**2. Preprocessing**
- **Dropped `Loan_ID`**: This unique identifier was removed as it does not contribute to prediction.
- **Handled Missing Values**: Missing data in `Dependents`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`, and `Credit_History` were imputed using the mean.
- **Checked for Duplicates**: Data integrity was ensured by verifying the absence of duplicate rows.

**3. Feature Selection**
- Categorical columns were identified for subsequent visualization and encoding.
- `Loan_ID` was explicitly excluded from the categorical features list to prevent errors.

**4. Visualization**
- Bar plots were generated for each categorical column to analyze distribution and potential impact on loan status.

**5. Model Building**
- Four machine learning classifiers were trained:
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
    - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
    - Logistic Regression (LC)
- Each model's accuracy was evaluated on the training data.

**6. Model Evaluation**
- The accuracy scores for each trained model were displayed.
